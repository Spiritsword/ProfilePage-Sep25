            <p>
                I have a background in digital marketing and market research, 
                but am looking to transition to software development. 
                I am qualified in mathematics (BA Oxford and PhD Edinburgh) 
                and technical programming (MSc Cranfield). I also have an interest 
                in Art and Musical Theatre writing, which I have studied 
                at university level. Web design and development services offered.

                <h1>Project 1: The Missing Piece</h1>
                <img src="./missing.piece.png" alt="Three-by-three sliding squares puzzle">
                <p>
                    This is the first of three game projects aiming to evoke feelings in the player enabling them to better appreciate concepts
                    related to the Christian faith. This online mini-game was written in Javascript. The player is presented with
                    a 3-by-3 sliding square puzzle without being told that is what it is, or given information
                    about what the solution would look like. When the square is solved, space for an image of Jesus is left in the centre, and
                    such an image fades in. A caption appears, "Jesus is the missing piece" along with a link to a video with more information.
                    The aim of the puzzle was to use a simple mechanism to evoke a feeling of puzzlement as to what the aim and rules of the game
                    even were, and to whether there was even any meaningful game present, metaphorically alluding to the search for the meaning
                    of life. Jesus being the missing piece alludes to the bible verse that states "in him all things hold together"
                    (Colossians 1:17). Technical challenges to building this included a lack of mathematical understanding of which initial
                    configurations were solvable. This necessitated generating the initial configuration by a random step-by-step disordering
                    of the solution configuration.

                <h1>Project 2: Greatest Treasure</h1>
                <img src="./greatest.treasure.jpg" alt="Image representing bidding war for fields">
                <p>
                    This is the second of the three Christian mini-game projects, and was also written in Javascript. It is intended to bring to
                    life the concept described in Matthew 13:44: "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again,
                    and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field." A particular challenge for this game was to handle responsiveness.
                    I had the visual components arranged on multiple layers, and each layer responded differently to changes in size and proportion of the screen, leading to
                    Undesirable occlusions. Future work would be to refactor the game to unify the responsive behaviour. Future work might also be to create a
                    tutorial.
