#### PERSONAL PROFILE PAGE PROJECT

The aim of this project was to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS skills by building a personal profile page. The page needed to include an "about" section with photo and profile summary, as well as at descriptions of at least two software  projects. It also needed to have page navigation, a contact-us form and email and phone links. Appropriate use of basic HTML and CSS was a requisite.

The folder "challenge" contains the project specification and marking scheme.

The folder "docs" contains the submission, including a folder of images, and the files index.htm, styles.css and discussion.md, the latter including a copy of the requirements, a discussion of initial design choices, and a broad-brush project plan.

The page can be found online at:
